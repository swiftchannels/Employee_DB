# Surfs Up!

![surfs-up.jpeg](Images/surfs-up.png)

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.

## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* Use the provided [starter notebook](climate_starter.ipynb) and [hawaii.sqlite](Resources/hawaii.sqlite) files to complete your climate analysis and data exploration.

* Choose a start date and end date for your trip. Make sure that your vacation range is approximately 3-15 days total.

* Use SQLAlchemy `create_engine` to connect to your sqlite database.

* Use SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` to reflect your tables into classes and save a reference to those classes called `Station` and `Measurement`.

### Precipitation Analysis

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

* Select only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plot the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Station Analysis

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Design a query to find the most active stations.

  * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.

  * Which station has the highest number of observations?

  * Hint: You may need to use functions such as `func.min`, `func.max`, `func.avg`, and `func.count` in your queries.

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).

  * Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.

  * Plot the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Step 2 - Climate App

Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

* Use FLASK to create your routes.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * List all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Convert the query results to a Dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * query for the dates and temperature observations from a year from the last data point.
  * Return a JSON list of Temperature Observations (tobs) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.

  * When given the start only, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.

  * When given the start and the end date, calculate the `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates between the start and end date inclusive.

## Hints

* You will need to join the station and measurement tables for some of the analysis queries.

* Use Flask `jsonify` to convert your API data into a valid JSON response object.

### Optional: Other Recommended Analyses

* The following are optional challenge queries. These are highly recommended to attempt, but not required for the homework.

### Temperature Analysis I

* Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?

* You may either use SQLAlchemy or pandas's `read_csv()` to perform this portion.

* Identify the average temperature in June at all stations across all available years in the dataset. Do the same for December temperature.

* Use the t-test to determine whether the difference in the means, if any, is statistically significant. Will you use a paired t-test, or an unpaired t-test? Why?

### Temperature Analysis II

* The starter notebook contains a function called `calc_temps` that will accept a start date and end date in the format `%Y-%m-%d` and return the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for that range of dates.

* Use the `calc_temps` function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for your trip using the matching dates from the previous year (i.e., use "2017-01-01" if your trip start date was "2018-01-01").

* Plot the min, avg, and max temperature from your previous query as a bar chart.

  * Use the average temperature as the bar height.

  * Use the peak-to-peak (tmax-tmin) value as the y error bar (yerr).

### Daily Rainfall Average

* Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates.

* Calculate the daily normals. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures.

* You are provided with a function called `daily_normals` that will calculate the daily normals for a specific date. This date string will be in the format `%m-%d`. Be sure to use all historic tobs that match that date string.

* Create a list of dates for your trip in the format `%m-%d`. Use the `daily_normals` function to calculate the normals for each date string and append the results to a list.

* Load the list of daily normals into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index equal to the date.

* Use Pandas to plot an area plot (`stacked=False`) for the daily normals.

# Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

![sql.png](sql.png)

## Background

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:

1. Data Modeling

2. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis

## Instructions

#### Data Modeling

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

#### Data Engineering

* Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

#### Data Analysis

Once you have a complete database, do the following:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. List employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

## Bonus (Optional)

As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss:

1. Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas, but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) This step may require some research. Feel free to use the code below to get started. Be sure to make any necessary modifications for your username, password, host, port, and database name:

   ```sql
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   engine = create_engine('postgresql://localhost:5432/<your_db_name>')
   connection = engine.connect()
   ```

* Consult [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#postgresql) for more information.

* If using a password, do not upload your password to your GitHub repository. See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I) and [https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/](https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/) for more information.

2. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.

3. You may also include a technical report in markdown format, in which you outline the data engineering steps taken in the homework assignment.

## Epilogue

Evidence in hand, you march into your boss's office and present the visualization. With a sly grin, your boss thanks you for your work. On your way out of the office, you hear the words, "Search your ID number." You look down at your badge to see that your employee ID number is 499942.
